===============

Pomegranate PKM is a new open source web-based cross-platform work and knowledge management application for productive and prolific people.

PKM features text-based commands for adding, updating and searching records, thus providing powerful tools to manage information. It also allows the user to build up the navigation menu using saved searches.
